# Car-Model-Prediction

Car Model prediction by Logo
## Project -
The aim is to develope a model to predict Car Brand by its Logo using Transfer learning in Convolutional Neural Network.


## Process followed
 It involves:
 
 * We freeze the early convolutional layers of the network and only train the last few layers which make a prediction.
 .
 

## Building Classification model.
Used models:

* Resnet50
